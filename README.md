# Burn-Degree-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
I developed a deep learning model for burn degree classification using user-uploaded images. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze the images and predict burn severity. Built with a Tkinter interface for easy interaction, the model leverages TensorFlow for accurate, real-time predictions.
