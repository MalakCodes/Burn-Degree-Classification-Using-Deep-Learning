Overview

This project uses deep learning to classify burn degrees based on images uploaded by users. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze burn images and predict their severity (e.g., minor, moderate, severe). The application is built with a user-friendly interface using Tkinter for interaction, and TensorFlow is used to train the model efficiently and provide real-time predictions.

Features
	•	Image Classification: The model analyzes burn images and classifies them based on their severity.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter to provide an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to upload images and view predictions.
	•	Deep Learning with TensorFlow: The model is trained on a burn image dataset using TensorFlow to deliver accurate and efficient predictions.
	•	Real-Time Predictions: Once an image is uploaded, the model provides immediate feedback on the predicted burn degree.
